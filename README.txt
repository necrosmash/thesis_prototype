This game prototype makes use of OpenAI's ChatGPT. In order to avail of this functionality, you must provide your own API key.

Upon acquiring a key, create a text file at the following path:
"thesis_prototype1_Data/OpenAiApiKey.txt"

Paste your key into this file as a single line. Do not add a line break at the end of the file.

Running the game prototype without this key will result in the game running in Test mode, using hardcoded data and no ChatGPT integration.
